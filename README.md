### IN This repo will be used mathmatical series like :

**The Fibonacci Series** is a numeric series starting with the integers 0 and 1. In this series, the next integer is determined by summing the previous two. This gives us:

``0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...``

***Note When asking for the nth number in series presume starting at zero.***

fibonacci(0) == 0, fibonacci(1) == 1, fibonacci(2) == 1, etc.

***The Lucas Numbers** are a related series of integers that start with the values 2 and 1 rather than 0 and 1. The resulting series looks like this:

``2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, ...``

Here we have 11 conditions to test 

Test case finenacci:
    0 => 0  ``if number is intered 0 will retrun 0 in finenacci serie`` 
    1 => 1  ``if number is intered 1 will retrun 1 in finenacci serie`` 
    2 => 1   ``if number is intered 2 will retrun 2 (it is the sum of previous 2 numbers(0,1) in finenacci serie`` 
Test case lucas:
    0 => 0  ``if number is intered 0 will retrun 2 in lucas serie`` 
    1 => 1  ``if number is intered 1 will retrun 1 in  lucas serie`` 
    2 => 1   ``if number is intered 2 will retrun 3 (it is the sum of previous 2 numbers(2,1) in lucas serie`` 
    
 Test case sum:
    6=> 8  ``if number is intered 6 will retrun 8 in finenacci serie === here we have condition if the optional parameters(0,1)`` 
    2 => 3 ``if number is intered 2 will retrun 3in  lucas serie  === here we have condition if the optional parameters(2,1)``
