### IN This repo will be used mathmatical series like :

**The Fibonacci Series** is a numeric series starting with the integers 0 and 1. In this series, the next integer is determined by summing the previous two. This gives us:

``0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...``

***Note When asking for the nth number in series presume starting at zero.***

fibonacci(0) == 0, fibonacci(1) == 1, fibonacci(2) == 1, etc.

***The Lucas Numbers** are a related series of integers that start with the values 2 and 1 rather than 0 and 1. The resulting series looks like this:

``2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, ...``

Here we have 11 conditions to test
